--Getting git on you system-- 
First thing you have to do before learning git is to go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download git bash.

verify by typing command git --version 

"C:\Users\Asad>git --version
 git version 2.32.0.windows.2"

-- Create project --
Now first create a directory anywhere on you system (in my case I did it on Desktop) this folder will content you all the project file
Navigate that directory on commad using cd "path"

to initilize run command - git init
